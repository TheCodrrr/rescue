# Train Station Integration Implementation

## Summary
Successfully integrated train station data functionality into the rail service. The system now fetches and stores all stations that a train stops at, including detailed information about each stop.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`rail.service.js`)
- Added `stations` JSONB column to the `trains` table
- Added GIN index for efficient querying of station data
- Handles both new table creation and existing table migration

### 2. Core Functions Added

#### `fetchTrainStations(train_number)`
- Fetches all stations for a given train from the erail.in API
- First gets train details to obtain `train_id`
- Then fetches route information using the route API
- Uses existing `prettify.GetRoute()` function to parse station data
- Returns array of station objects with details:
  ```javascript
  {
    source_stn_name: "Station Name",
    source_stn_code: "STN",
    arrive: "HH:MM",
    depart: "HH:MM", 
    distance: "123",
    day: "1",
    zone: "Zone"
  }
  ```

#### `updateTrainStations(train_number)`
- Updates station data for an existing train in the database
- Fetches fresh station data from API and stores it

#### `getTrainStations(train_number)`
- Retrieves stored station data for a train from database

#### `updateAllTrainStations()`
- Batch function to update all trains that don't have station data
- Includes rate limiting to avoid API throttling

### 3. Enhanced Functions

#### Modified `ensureTrainExists()`
- Now fetches and stores station data when creating new train records
- Integrates station fetching into the train creation workflow

#### Modified `addTrain()`
- Updated to handle the new `stations` parameter
- Stores station data as JSONB in the database

#### Enhanced `searchTrainByStation()`
- Now searches both routes and station arrays
- Can find trains that stop at intermediate stations, not just origin/destination

### 4. API Controllers (`rail.controllers.js`)
- `getTrainStationsHandler`: Get stations for a specific train
- `updateTrainStationsHandler`: Update station data for a train
- `searchTrainsByStationHandler`: Find trains stopping at a station
- `updateAllTrainStationsHandler`: Admin function to update all trains

### 5. API Routes (`rail.routes.js`)
- `GET /train/:trainNumber/stations` - Get train stations
- `POST /train/:trainNumber/stations/update` - Update train stations
- `GET /station/:stationCode/trains` - Search trains by station
- `POST /admin/trains/update-stations` - Update all missing station data

## Usage Examples

### Fetch stations for a train:
```javascript
import { getTrainStations, fetchTrainStations } from './services/rail.service.js';

// Get from database
const stations = await getTrainStations('12301');

// Fetch fresh from API
const freshStations = await fetchTrainStations('12301');
```

### Update stations for existing trains:
```javascript
import { updateTrainStations, updateAllTrainStations } from './services/rail.service.js';

// Update single train
await updateTrainStations('12301');

// Update all trains missing station data
await updateAllTrainStations();
```

### API Usage:
```bash
# Get stations for train 12301
GET /api/train/12301/stations

# Update stations for train 12301
POST /api/train/12301/stations/update

# Find trains stopping at station code NDLS
GET /api/station/NDLS/trains

# Update all trains (admin)
POST /api/admin/trains/update-stations
```

## Data Structure
Each train now has a `stations` array containing:
```json
{
  "stations": [
    {
      "source_stn_name": "New Delhi",
      "source_stn_code": "NDLS",
      "arrive": "20:05",
      "depart": "20:05",
      "distance": "0",
      "day": "1",
      "zone": "NR"
    },
    {
      "source_stn_name": "Ghaziabad",
      "source_stn_code": "GZB", 
      "arrive": "20:43",
      "depart": "20:45",
      "distance": "19",
      "day": "1",
      "zone": "NR"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Files Modified/Created
- ✅ `src/services/rail.service.js` - Core functionality
- ✅ `src/controllers/rail.controllers.js` - API controllers (new)
- ✅ `src/routes/rail.routes.js` - API routes (new)
- ✅ `test_stations.js` - Test script (new)

## Integration Steps
1. Database schema automatically updates when `initRailSchema()` is called
2. New trains automatically get station data via `ensureTrainExists()`
3. Existing trains can be updated using the batch update function
4. API endpoints available for manual updates and queries
